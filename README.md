# Virtual Piano with OpenCV and Mediapipe

## Overview

This project implements a virtual piano using OpenCV and Mediapipe, allowing users to play music by interacting with their hands in front of a camera. The application detects hand keypoints using Mediapipe's Hand module and maps them to corresponding piano keys on the screen.
